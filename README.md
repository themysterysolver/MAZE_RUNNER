## 🌀 MAZE RUNNER

- This is a browser-based maze game that brings nostalgia!
- We have  a `start` and `end`,the goal is to reach the end.
- There are 2 randomly chosen maps to keep it fresh each time you play!
- Works both in `PC` and `mobile`.🤓

## 🚀 Future optimization
- I coded the maze manually which took a lot of time.🥵
- During this time(halfway though),I got an idea to optimally build walls,so I will build new maps by coding it smartly than doing manual labour.
- ~~To make it resposnive.~~

## 🫂 Special thanks
